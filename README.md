Here I will post all my Rust exercises/side-projects, besides the 42 Wolfsburg coding school.
I will begin with easy projects and increase difficulty steadily.
I will record my progress in the meantime.

## First project:
- **Mars weigh Calculator**: *an easy project which calculates the equivalent weight of a person from Earth to the one on Mars.*
	  *My progress:*
		-learned to use the Cargo package manager;
		-learned about crates in Rust;
		-learned about the standard library / crate;
		-learned about the .unwrap() method.
		-learned about the prinln! macro.
		-learned about the 3 main rules in Rust:
					A) Each value in Rust is owned by a variable.
					B) When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be deallocated.
					C) There can be only ONE owner at a time.
		 -still getting familiar with Rust syntax
