Here I will post all my Rust exercises/side-projects, besides the 42 Wolfsburg coding school.
I will begin with easy projects and increase difficulty steadily.
I will record my progress in the meantime.

## 1st project:

**Mars weigh Calculator**: *an easy project which calculates the equivalent weight of a person from Earth to the one on Mars.*

**Shopping list**: *an easy project which makes use of an infinite loop, the match statement and string/vector methods in order to add items to a shopping list, which is then displayed in a for loop. This is done in parralel to the Rustlings exercises and Leetcode.com exercises for arrays.*
