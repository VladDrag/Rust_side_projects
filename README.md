Here I will post all my Rust exercises/side-projects, besides the 42 Wolfsburg coding school.
I will begin with easy projects and increase difficulty steadily.
I will record my progress in the meantime.

## First project:

**Mars weigh Calculator**: *an easy project which calculates the equivalent weight of a person from Earth to the one on Mars.*
